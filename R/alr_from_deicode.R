## Purpose: Calculate additive log ratios for presence of features, ranking features along PC coordinates

library(dplyr)

## Check that the sample names of the coordinate and feature tables match
## and that the Feature ID is in the first column in both dataset

  }
  if(!identical(features[,featurcol],coords[,featurcol])){
    stop("Order of Feature IDs in feature table should match order of Feature IDs in coordinates")
