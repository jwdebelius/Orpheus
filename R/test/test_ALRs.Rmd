##Setup

library(data.table)
```

**Create a test OTU presence dataset**

```{r}
test_otus<-data.frame("FeatureID" = c(paste0("A",1:6)),
                      "Sample1" = c(1,0,0,0,0,0),
                      "Sample2" = c(0,1,0,0,0,0),
                      "Sample3" = c(0,0,1,0,0,0),
                      "Sample4" = c(0,0,0,0,0,1))

test_otus
```

**Create a dataset for PCA coordinates already in an ascending order.**

This way I know feature A1, then A2, then A3 etc will count towards the numerator

```{r}
coords_test<- data.frame("FeatureID" = c(paste0("A",1:6)),
                         "PC1"= c(-0.1, -0.01, 0.00,0.01, 0.1, 0.2))

coords_test
```

**Compute ALRs samples.**

Since each sample had just 1 OTU in the numerator and 1 in the denominator, all ALRs = 0.

```{r}
alr(features = test_otus, coords = coords_test, pc = "PC1", thresh =0)
```

**Create another test OTU presence data set, this time making samples have more features in the numerator.**

```{r}
test_otus2<-data.frame("FeatureID" = c(paste0("A",1:6)),
                       "Sample1" = c(1,1,1,1,1,1),
                       "Sample2" = c(0,1,1,1,1,1),
                       "Sample3" = c(0,0,1,1,1,1),
                       "Sample4" = c(0,0,0,0,0,1),
                       "Sample5" = c(0,0,0,0,1,0),
                       "Sample6" = c(0,0,0,1,1,0),
                       "Sample7" = c(0,0,0,2,3,0))

test_otus2

# coords_test
```

Sample1 ALR should be log2((6+1)/(2+1)) = 1.2223924

Sample2 ALR should be log2((5 + 1)/(2 + 1)) = 1

Sample3 ALR should be log2((4 + 1)/(2 + 1)) = 0.7369656

Sample4 ALR should be log2((1 + 1)/(1 + 1)) = 0

Sample5 ALR should be log2((1 + 1)/(1 + 1)) = 0

Sample6 ALR should be log2((2 + 1)/(1 + 1)) = 0.5849625

Sample7 ALR should be log2((5 + 1)/(3 + 1)) = 0.5849625

**Compute ALRs for each sample:**

```{r}
alr(features = test_otus2, coords = coords_test, pc = "PC1")

```



```{r}
test_otus3<-data.frame("FeatureID" = c(paste0("A",1:6)),
                       "Sample1" = c(2,3,5,3,7,1),
                       "Sample2" = c(0,2,3,5,3,7),
                       "Sample3" = c(0,0,2,3,5,1),
                       "Sample4" = c(0,0,0,0,0,7),
                       "Sample5" = c(0,0,0,0,3,0),
                       "Sample6" = c(0,0,0,2,6,0),
                       "Sample7" = c(0,0,0,6,7,0))

test_otus3

```

```{r}
alr(features = test_otus3, coords = coords_test, pc = "PC1", thresh = 1)
```

Minimizing overlap between numerator and denominator:

```{r}
test_otus3$Sample4 <- c(0,0,0,7,0,0)
test_otus3$Sample5 <- c(0,0,0,3,0,0)

alr(features = test_otus3, coords = coords_test, pc = "PC1")

```

Modifying the proportion of samples the OTU must be present in:

```{r}
alr(features = test_otus3, coords = coords_test, pc = "PC1", prop_samp = 0.7)
```
